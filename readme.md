# ✡️ TefillaHub

Hey there! 👋 I'm building **TefillaHub** — a simple and clean web app that shows live Jewish stuff like:

- 📅 The current **Hebrew date**
- 🔥 **Omer count**
- 📖 This week’s **Torah portion**
- 🕰️ **Zmanim** (important Jewish times)

All made with React + Tailwind CSS, and powered by [Hebcal](https://www.hebcal.com/) under the hood.

---

## 💭 Why I made this

I wanted a single place where I could quickly check today’s Hebrew date, zmanim, and what parsha we’re up to — something minimal, good-looking, and easy to access. I wanted a nice siddur.

---

## 🚧 What’s in the works

- ✅ Hebrew date updates live
- ✅ Zmanim showing properly for your location
- ✅ Omer count during the right time of year
- ✅ Torah portion for the current week

---

## 🎯 What’s coming

I'm still building! Some ideas in the pipeline:

- 📍 Let you manually set your location
- 📆 Jewish calendar view
- 🌗 Candle lighting reminders

## 🙋‍♂️ Got ideas?
